# Health-Prediction
Multiple Disease Prediction System
Multiple Disease Prediction System

This repository contains a Streamlit web application for predicting three different health conditions: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease using machine learning models. Developed by harish,saisaran,sukruthi this interactive tool allows users to input relevant health parameters and receive predictions for each disease.

Key Features:

Diabetes Prediction: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on input parameters.
Heart Disease Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a trained machine learning model with various cardiovascular health indicators.
Parkinson's Disease Prediction: Determines the presence of Parkinson's disease by analyzing voice-related features through a machine learning model.
Usage Instructions:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the application with streamlit run app.py.
Navigate through the sidebar to select the disease prediction page of interest.
Input relevant health parameters and click the respective prediction button.
Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or customize the application for your specific needs. The machine learning models are trained and saved using Python's pickle module, making it easy to integrate into other projects or applications.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x
Streamlit
scikit-learn
